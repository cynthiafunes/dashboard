            Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world without requiring a central authority, like a bank or government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit of 21 million coins, making it inherently resistant to inflation. All transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain.
